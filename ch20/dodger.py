# Dodger
#   A simple graphical game where the
#   player must dosge the bad guys.
"""
The Dodger game has the player control
a small person (which we call the
playerâ€™s character) who must dodge
a whole bunch of baddies that fall
from the top of the screen. The
longer the player can keep dodging
the baddies, the higher the score they
will get.
